Proposed List of Absolute Must Haves:
0. 3D Physics Simulation suitable for Space Exploration and Planetary Colonization.
1. Celestial Bodies that Orbit Around Eachother (on rails) with an underlying hierarchical  nodal reference.
2. Gravity that is SOI for Celestial Bodies which effect player characters and ships.
3. Ability to move around the surface of a celestial body without falling through or getting constantly stuck due to terrain structures.
4. Ability to move from one Celestial Body to another based on a gravitational model.
5. Celestrial Bodies segmented into the following aspects:
  A) Stars (Produce Light)
  B) Rocket Planets/Moons (Surfaces)
  C) Ocean Planets (Water/Liquids)
  D) Gas Planets (Atmospheres)
6. Parts to make a Rocket Ship and Colony
7. Basic ISRU System - mining>ore, atmosphere>fuel, ore+fuel>rockets (This will be replaced and significantly expanded once the core system is working)
